<h4> My opinion on the course </h4>
        <p> I personally really enjoy this class as I find it both interesting and morally and ethically challenging. The course causes me to think both obectively as well as challenging me to think creatively. I also currently have a 98% in the class, so that is always a bonus :) </p>
