     <h1>This course is taught by PhD candidate Brooke Covington</h1>

     <p>Literature, Medicine, and Culture looks at how literature assits us in the understanding and nature of diseases, illnesses, and suffering across various cultures. The course uses many different mediums to convey this, such as poetry, fiction, movies, memoirs, art, as well as essays. We use the knowledge gained from the many texts and annicdotes that we read to reflect on the connections between literature, medicine, illness and healing. </p2>

       <p2> Brooke Covington is currently pursing a doctorate degree in English here at Virginia Tech and is currently working on her thesis that explains the relationshiop between people or groups to symbolic areas. For example, she looks at the ways that peopel interact with th pylons, the mmeorial, Norris Hall, etc.</p2>

        <p3> I persoanlly really enjoy this class as I find it both interesting and morally and ethically challenging, it causes me to think both obectively as well as challenging me to think creatively. I also currently have a 98% in the class as well so that is always a bonus :) </p3>
