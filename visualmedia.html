 <h3>About my Professor</h3>
      <p> Carlos Evia majored in communications as an undergraduate and went on to recieve his masters degree in computer science. These to different fields allow for him to have a different out look on visual media when it concerns things such as website design becuase he knows both how to code the website for functionality, and how to make it look visually pleasing to veiwers.  </p>

<h4> My opinion on the course </h4>
        <p> I personally greatly enjoy visual media as it allows me to express myself and when writing memos I get to see how much I have learned. I like that I can use something I am passionate about (photography) to convey meaning and emotion to others. </p>
