     <h1>This course is taught by Professor Carlos Evia </h1>
<br>
<h2>Course Description</h2>
     <p> Visual Media is a course created to introduce students to the concepts and skills needed to work in the fields of media, journalism, public relations. In this course we heavily work with the Adobe program, creative cloud as well as using our writing skills to create memos for each project that we are assigned.</p>
 <br>
 <h2>About my Professor </h2>
      <p> Carlos Evia majored in communications as an undergraduate and went on to receive his master's degree in computer science. These to different fields allow for him to have a different outlook on visual media when it concerns things such as website design because he knows both how to code the website for functionality, and how to make it look visually pleasing to viewers.  </p>

<h2> My opinion on the course </h2>
        <p> I personally greatly enjoy visual media as it allows me to express myself and when writing memos I get to see how much I have learned. I like that I can use something I am passionate about (photography) to convey meaning and emotion to others. </p>
